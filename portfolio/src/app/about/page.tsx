        Hey there! I&apos;m Caroline, a seasoned professional in travel tech and software development. With a decade of industry experience under my belt, I&apos;ve worn many hats â€” from managing accounts at leading companies like Expedia and Airbnb, to diving deep into the world of software development.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-2">
        Ever since I was a child, inspired by shows like $quot;Great Hotels,$ldquo; I knew I was destined for the travel industry. From mimicking TV hosts on family vacations to pursuing formal education at the Hotel School at Cornell, my journey has been one for the books (or perhaps a travel blog).
